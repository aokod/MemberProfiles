### MemberProfiles
Adds "profile settings" to the user settings, which gives the user a bunch of customization settings for their profile.  Also adds signatures to posts.  The visibility of both a user's "about me" and signature can be configured as well.

This plugin was originally created by esoBB developer @GigaHacer in order to add signatures to posts.  It has since been added upon in order to include numerous other features.

#### To-do list
 - [X] Prevent signatures from being confused by pagination
